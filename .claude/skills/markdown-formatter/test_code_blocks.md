Testing code block detection.

Here is a python block:
```python
import os
def hello():
    print("Hello World")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello()
```

Here is a bash block:
```bash
ls -la
echo "test"
sudo apt-get install python3
```

Here is an already labeled block:
```javascript
console.log("Ignore me");
```

Here is a plan text block:
```
Just some text
No code here
```
